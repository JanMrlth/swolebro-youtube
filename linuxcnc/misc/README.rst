Miscellaneous LinuxCNC Stuff
============================

This directory is for pointers about setting up and using a LinuxCNC system,
apart from the actual CNC part of it. Some of this is specific to LinuxCNC, and
some of it relates to just Linux as a whole.

Think of it as a follow-up to `this video`_, with more detailed instructions and
additional topics. Text really is a better way to convey this stuff anyway,
especially since you can't ever edit/update/add to a YouTube video once you've
uploaded it.

Warning
=======

Of utmost importance for LinuxCNC v2.7.14 is that it is based on Debian 7
(aka. Wheezy), which is **extremely old** (circa 2013). So, if you want to
install additional software, you will need need to update your apt-get
sources.

See ``installing-software.rst`` for more.
