As discussed in the videos, the thcud component included in LinuxCNC is a
little bit janky. So, to pile hack upon hack, I went and put a gist up on
GitHub with some fixes, that will be important if you want to use all the same
features I do, particularly in the PyVCP panel.

You can install that with the following command line calls:

wget https://gist.github.com/swolebro/483973b2081784baca9f04a9a95c6cea/archive/master.zip
unzip master.zip
cd 483973b2081784baca9f04a9a95c6cea-master/
sudo halcompile --install thcud.comp

I might try and get these changes included in the project, but they won't
come around until at least LinuxCNC 2.8 in that case, and even that could
take a while.

The component file is kept in a separate GitHub gist for licensing reasons.
It's free software under the GPL, whereas this project is open source non-free
software, as discussed in the videos.
